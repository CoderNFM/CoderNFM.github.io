They are typically used to control access to files, directories, and other resources on a server.ACLs can be used to allow or deny access to a resource based on the identity of the user or group of users. They can also be used to control what actions a user or group can take on a resource. For example, an ACL can be used to allow a group of users to read a file, but not write to it.ACLs are typically managed by a system administrator. They can be configured manually or automatically based on the security policy of an organization.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Encryption]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Encryption is a technique used to protect data or communication from unauthorized access.
